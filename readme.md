To correct work with spases in file names and paths use singlequotes for both paths (if there are 2 of them). In this case its impossible to use singlequotes in filenames.

Sometimes is is not nessesery to send path_for_destination, in this case file will be copied (or compressed) with autogenerated name in the same directory.
